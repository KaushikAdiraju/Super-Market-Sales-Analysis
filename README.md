# Super-Market-Sales-Analysis
Overall Business objective – kept in simple words what’s the scope of the analysis
and what business problem is being solved (this ensures that you’ve gone through the
client’s requirement)
▪ Understanding of the problem in your own words (this helps align your understanding
of the business problem with client’s requirement)
▪ Approach – Very high-level view of the approach you plan to use to address the
problem (this helps the client see that you have a plan in place to attack the problem)
